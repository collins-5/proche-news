        "content": "China has started sea trials for its most advanced amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan Type 076. The Sichuan Type 076 vessel, which set sail from Shanghai's Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard, combines some of the attributes of an aircraft carrier and earlier amphibious assault ships, with the ability to launch both aircraft and landing craft loaded with troops. commissioned by China on Nov. 7, with a displacement of some 40,000 tons. Both ships were indigenously designed and built. Exact technical specifications have not been released, but amphibious assault ships are typically faster than carriers, which gives them more operational flexibility, but they are more lightly protected against attack, and cannot carry as many or as broad a range of aircraft. China's navy already has more ships than the U.S. Navy, but it lags behind in capabilities with fewer aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships and other key vessels. It has embarked on a massive building program, however, as part of leader Xi Jinping's broad military modernization plan. Xi's stated aim is to have a fully modernized force by 2035 and one that is “world class” by mid-century, which is widely interpreted as one whose capabilities rival those of the United States. One of Xi's goals is to take the democratically self-governed island of Taiwan, and he has not ruled out the use of force. Amphibious assault ships would likely be critical for an invasion of Taiwan, though the island is also bristling with missile defense systems that could make any attempt to use them costly. The Sichuan compares roughly to the U.S. Navy's America-class and Wasp-class amphibious assault ships. However, it is equipped with the same modern electromagnetic catapult system that has been successfully tested on, while the American ships lack such launch systems and instead can only operate helicopters and short or vertical take-off and landing planes. Official Chinese media reported that the electromagnetic system would allow the Sichuan to launch fixed-wing aircraft in addition to helicopters and STOVL and VTOL planes, but it was not yet clear whether it would be limited to drones or whether it could launch crewed fixed-wing aircraft like fighter jets. That will likely become known during the later stages of the sea trials as the Sichuan's capabilities are tested.Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

US-China Trade Tensions Easing: Tariffs Stabilize, China's Exports Remain Resilient Standard Chartered economists anticipate a stabilization of US-China tariffs through 2026, marking a de-escalation of trade tensions. Despite existing tariffs, China's exports have remained strong due to diversification, innovation, and upgrading, offsetting weak domestic demand. The report highlights the effectiveness of China's trade strategies, including rare earth controls, and projects a sizable current account surplus driven by efficiency gains and technology advancements.

        "title": "Carney announces next of nation-building projects: A look at what made the list",
        "description": "One new strategy, and six new initiatives, including three focused on critical mineral extraction and one for the export of liquefied national gas, have been added to the growing list of plans referred to the Major Projects Office.",
        "content": "Three critical mineral extraction projects, a nickel mine in Ontario and a transmission line on the northern B.C. coast are among the new initiatives added to the growing list of projects referred to the Major Projects Office. Prime Minister Mark Carney says the “transformational” projects announced Thursday in northern B.C. represent more than $56 billion in new investment and will support 68,000 jobs. “Each of these projects that we are referring to the MPO today, in and of itself, is transformational, but the bigger point is that their impacts will be amplified by being part of bigger national strategies to boost Canada’s competitiveness,” Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday. The projects include: North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL) in Northwestern British Columbia that will power new mines and export expansion. Ksi Lisims LNG on Pearse Island, B.C. aims to become Canada’s second-largest LNG facility Canada Nickel’s Crawford Project in Timmins, Ont. that will produce nickel for batteries and green steel. Nouveau Monde Graphite’s Matawinie Mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints, Que. is an open-pit graphite mine that aims to provide inputs for battery supply chains and defence applications. Northcliff Resources’ Sisson Mine in Sisson Brook, N.B. will produce tungsten used in steel production, as well as the defence and industrial sectors Iqaluit Nukkiksautiit Hydro Project in Iqaluit, Nunavut seeks to become Nunavut’s first 100 per cent Inuit-owned hydro energy project, delivering cleaner energy to the city of Iqaluit. In addition to those projects, Carney also referred the Northwest Critical Conservation Corridor in Northwest British Columbia and the Yukon to the MPO. The corridor sits atop a vast deposit of critical minerals and referring it, Carney said, will help strengthen Canada’s position as a global leader in clean energy and critical minerals while also getting new transmission lines, upgraded highways, and new fibre and cell towers built. The corridor is part of the federal government’s so-called Critical Minerals Strategy . “This Northwest Corridor has extraordinary potential for critical minerals development, clean power transmission, and Indigenous leadership,” he said. “It can unlock billions in investments, while creating a new conservation area the size of Greece.” The prime minister has said these kinds of major projects are crucial to increase exports, create jobs and stimulate the tariff-hit economy. “Today is not just about what we build, it is also about how we build,” Carney said. “We are building sustainably, in each case reducing emissions and investing in a clean energy future.” The prime minister made the announcement from Terrace, B.C. where one end of the North Coast Transmission Line is set to be located. Ottawa says the transmission line will tie the Northwest Critical Conservation Corridor together to deliver low-cost, clean electricity and bolstered telecommunications to West Coast communities. To support the project, the Canada Infrastructure Bank announced today that it is loaning $139.5 million to B.C. Hydro.” A growing list of projects Thursday’s announcement comes roughly two months after the prime minister unveiled the first group projects. Those five projects referred to the MPO include: The LNG Canada Phase 2, based in Kitimat, B.C. The Darlington New Nuclear Project in Bowmanville, Ont. that would make Canada the first G7 country to have an operational small modular reactor (SMR) The Contrecœur Terminal Container Project in Contrecœur, Que. that would expand the Port of Montreal’s capacity by approximately 60 per cent The McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine Project in east-central Saskatchewan The Red Chris Mine expansion in northwest British Columbia “The Major Projects Office is helping build Canada smarter and quicker; fast-tracking the infrastructure we need to unlock our country’s immense resources,” Carney said. “This will build new communities, grow new businesses, and create tens of thousands of new careers in sustainable industries.” What is the Major Projects Office? The federal government says the Major Projects Office will streamline and fast-track the regulatory approval of major nation-building projects and help them pull in private sector investments. By creating a single set of conditions, the office is tasked with reducing the approval timeline for these projects to a maximum of two years. Established under Bill C-5 — dubbed the Building Canada Act by the Liberals — the MPO gives the federal government sweeping new powers to approve these major projects. Carney said Thursday that Bill C-5 changed the government’s approach to building from “why” to “how.” So far, none of the recommended projects have received that official designation. Asked how being on the list has helped the first group of projects, the prime minister said the referral helps projects take advantage of streamlined processes, and financing support. “It moves these projects more quickly to the decision, whether they move forward or not,” he said, adding that the work has been “appreciated” by proponents. Carney added that being on the list ultimately gives people greater confidence the projects will proceed. “That in and of itself creates more activity,” he said. The MPO was allocated $214 million in the 2025 Budget. It is being led by the former CEO and chair of the board of directors of the Trans Mountain Corporation Dawn Farrell. What about an Alberta Pipeline? The second tranche of projects does not include a bitumen pipeline from Alberta to B.C. North’s Coast, something Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has been pushing for. Asked where negotiations stand with Alberta on the so-called grand bargain and whether a pipeline would be announced by this weekend’s Grey Cup, Carney said discussion are going well. “I am personally encouraged by the progress that we are making,” he said. “There are a few more issues that we are ironing out and I , am looking forward to that progress over the course of the coming weeks.” Carney went on to say that this is an “important process” for the province and the country. “We want to make sure we are doing it right,” he said. Carney’s comments come about a week after he told a Bay Street audience not to worry because “we’re on the pipeline stuff.” Carney did not elaborate or offer any further details but did tell the Canadian Club of Toronto audience that “something’s going to happen, let’s put it that way.” What are the politicians saying? British Columbia Premier David Eby said he is pleased to see new B.C.-based projects are being prioritized by the federal government. “It sends a signal to the federal bureaucracy that this is a priority,” he said. Eby says he hopes today’s announcement results in more federal funding being diverted to these projects, saying he intends to make very explicit asks for financial support. “No question there is going to be financial asks for these major projects,” he said. “I will give the prime minister ... 48 hours before the very strongly worded letters go out.” Eby has repeatedly said he does not want a new Alberta bitumen pipeline built. Asked on Thursday whether he thought the prioritization of several B.C.-based initiatives was a way to “lessen the blow” if a pipeline is eventually referred to the MPO, Eby said it’s not happening. “It is no surprise to me that there is no heavy oil pipeline on this list, because there is no list, there is no proponent, there is no project,” he said. “It is a figment of a communications person’s mind in Alberta, and it has no connection to real investment in our country or in our province.” New Brunswick’s mining industry also got a boost today, with the inclusion of Northcliff Resources’ Sisson Mine in Sisson Brook on the MPO’s list. The proposed mine, which would extract the critical minerals tungsten and molybdenum , obtained federal environmental approvals in 2017. New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt said things came together recently, but that the CEO had been talking to the head of the MPO for some time. In terms of financing, Holt said the province is looking for a price floor or an offtake agreement that would essentially guarantee a buyer of the mine’s products. “Those two tools help both attract more investment and secure the value of the resource and that, those are critical pieces to this project,” she said, adding that the Department of National Defence recently made an investment in the mine. Asked whether she expects any other New Brunswick projects to be added to the list, Holt said she has seen some pathways in Budget 2025 for priority projects. “As the prime minister has said, this is a living list ... so where we see things that have both benefits to the region, to the province and the country, we will continue to push those.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Ontario Premier Doug Ford says they welcome Ottawa’s focus on the streamlining of approvals for the Crawford project. The statement goes on to say that the province hopes Ottawa will work to remove federal duplications for all projects, and “welcomes” the federal government joining forces with the province to develop a national nuclear strategy. Speaking in Kelowna, Conservative Party Pierre Poilievre leader criticized the Liberal government for being too slow to approve and build major energy and resource projects. The MPO, he said, represents another bureaucratic hurdle for companies to jump through. “Instead of getting things done, Mark Carney was standing up doing photo ops, announcing he is going to approve a bunch of projects that were already going to happen,” Poilievre said. Poilievre went on to say that Carney and the government need to step out of the way. “Carney is not actually getting anything done, he is just showing up to take credit for things that were going to happen anyway,” he said.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Export Promotion Mission (EPM) will improve export competitiveness, help MSMEs, first-time exporters and sectors that are labour-intensive. New Delhi: The Reserve Bank has permitted exporters to bring proceeds of their shipments in 15 months as against the prevailing timeframe of 9 months in view of stress being faced by them. Exporters are facing issues due to a steep tariff imposed by the US on Indian shipments since August. The US imposed a steep 50 per cent tariff on goods from India, which took effect on August 27. Currently, the value of goods or software exports made by exporters is required to be realised fully and repatriated to the country within a period of nine months from the date of export. The changes have been made following amendments to the Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods & Services) Regulations. These regulations may be called the Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods and Services) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2025, a gazette notification dated November 13 by RBI regional director Rohit P Das said. “They shall come into force from the date of their publication in the Official Gazette,” it said. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had extended this timeframe for exporters to 15 months during 2020 during the COVID-19 period. Earlier in the week, the government approved two schemes with a combined outlay of over Rs 45,000 crore for exporters, which are expected to help boost the country’s outbound shipments and enhance the competitiveness of domestic goods in the global markets. The government on Wednesday approved the Export Promotion Mission (Rs 25,060 crore) and the Credit Guarantee Scheme (Rs 20,000 crore). Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Export Promotion Mission (EPM) will improve export competitiveness, help MSMEs, first-time exporters and sectors that are labour-intensive.

        "content": "Brazil Pushes for Swift Resolution on US Tariff Dispute The Brazilian government expects the United States to deliver, as early as possible, a response to Brasilia's proposal to resolve the 50% tariff imposed by Washington on Brazilian products. The information was disclosed by Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira after a meeting in Washington with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Speaking to reporters, Vieira said Brazil's counterproposal was examined during a video conference involving officials from the Foreign Ministry, Finance Ministry, and Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce, along with representatives of the US Trade Representative. \"We presented proposals for resolving the issue,\" he said. The document handed over in Washington serves as Brazil's formal reply to the list of demands the US submitted in October, according to Brasil 247. Vieira said Rubio informed him that US President Donald Trump had already been briefed on the meeting and that Trump showed a willingness to move fast. \"The president expressed his intention to resolve things quickly, to maintain a good relationship with Brazil, and he said he really liked the meeting he had with President Lula in Malaysia,\" Vieira stated. He added that Washington's response could arrive \"tomorrow or next week\", depending on internal assessments at the White House. Rubio also reportedly reaffirmed the US interest in reaching a provisional agreement by late November or early December, establishing what he described as a \"road map\" for broader negotiations in the following months. According to Vieira, such talks \"could take two or three months until all matters between both countries are definitively concluded\". Citing Brasil 247, Vieira emphasised that the political dialogue between the two governments was reopened directly by President Lula and President Trump after their meeting in Malaysia. The goal is to unblock longstanding bilateral obstacles whilst technical teams advance negotiations through specialised working groups. He said Washington appears committed to \"turning this page and getting closer to Brazil\". Amazon Nations Launch Joint Monitoring Project at COP30 Meanwhile, at COP30 in Belem, the eight-member Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organisation (ACTO) announced a joint project to enhance Amazon monitoring, supported by R$ 55 million from the BNDES via the Amazon Fund, Agencia Brasil reported. The project aims to integrate scientific and technological data to combat deforestation and environmental degradation across the Amazon region. Environment Minister Marina Silva said the plan includes forming a science-technical panel to support climate, biodiversity, water, and fisheries policies. Brazil's space research agency INPE will provide monitoring technology to other ACTO nations. ACTO secretary-general Martin von Hildebrand called for unified regional monitoring, stressing that \"every tree is important\". BNDES socio-environmental director Tereza Campello added that harmonising methodologies is essential since \"if we don't unify the methodology, organised crime wins.\" (ANI) (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by Asianet Newsable English staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "content": "As a pessimist, I always figured it was a matter of time before Democrats would decide to counter the rise of a grievance-based populist Right with a grievance-based populist Left. We saw shades of this in the 2020 election, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) came perilously close to securing the Democratic presidential nomination.My worst fears weren't realized in Tuesday's election, but the results did leave me with some concern. Since the beginning of Donald Trump's second term, Republicans have created never-ending chaos. They've embraced an imperial presidency, massive tax increases (tariffs), abusive ICE raids, and have put divisive culture war stunts above bread-and-butter issues, even as inflation soars and the economy stumbles.So, as much as I disagree with Democrats, I was pleased that Democratic candidates won the gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey. Those politicians are moderates who focus on cost-of-living issues, so it's a sign the party might be learning that Bill Clinton-style centrism is a better strategy than Sanders-style socialism. These are Blue states, but a deeper dive shows that Democrats made huge gains in deeply Red areas. Latino voters shifted back in their direction.But there's always an outlier, and on Tuesday it was a big one. Zohran Mamdani won a convincing victory in the New York City mayoral race. Sure, New York is a liberal city, and he beat two ne'er-do-well opponents. Andrew Cuomo resigned as governor in 2021 amid a scandal. The red-beret-wearing Curtis Sliwa founded the crime-fighting Guardian Angels in the 1970s, but was never a serious challenger.In his victory speech, Mamdani showed his rhetorical skill, his penchant for bombast, and his populist take: \"We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. And we won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something that we do.\"Mamdani did focus on cost-of-living issues, which are dominant in a city where $4,000 a month rents you a tiny dump without a dishwasher. But instead of taking a traditional approach toward reducing prices, he promised to impose a rent freeze on property owners. His major issues are all disastrous, including government-run grocery stores, universal day care, free buses, and a $30 minimum wage. It would all be funded by a $5 billion increase in corporate taxes. It's typical socialist claptrap, backed by soaring invective against oligarchs.Avoiding any subtlety, Mamdani began his speech by quoting Eugene Debs: \"I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity.\" Debs was a fascinating character, but was a self-described radical who ran as a socialist for president. His opponent, the odious Democrat Woodrow Wilson, had him jailed for 10 years under the Espionage Act for giving an anti-war speech in Ohio in 2018. Debs campaigned from his cell and was ultimately released by President Warren Harding in 1921, per PBS.I found this Mamdani line most alarming: \"We will prove that there is no problem too large for government to solve, and no concern too small for it to care about.\" There's nothing more troublesome than a government that finds no problem too small to care about—and governments have a terrible track record for solving large ones.Mamdani did make some nods to boosting bureaucratic efficiency and improving public safety, but populists always pepper their speeches with promises that almost everyone can support. His defense of immigrants was stirring, and his jabs at Donald Trump were entertaining. He also spoke out against antisemitism, which perhaps softened concern about his views on Israel. He has a gift for gab, but Mamdani poses a danger for those of us who would like American politics to return to normalcy.His policy prescriptions are ruinous. Another socialist, Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck, correctly quipped that \"rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing.\" That's because rent freezes discourage housing construction, leading to scarcity, crumbling buildings, and higher prices over time. Government grocery stores are a joke. Wherever they've been tried, they're best known for empty shelves. Free buses become roving homeless shelters. Corporate tax boosts will send companies to the suburbs.New Yorkers' best hope is that the city's budget constraints will impose some fiscal reality on Mamdani's pipedreams and that he'll end up governing in a more prudent manner. I don't live in New York, so it's not my problem. But I do fear that national Democrats might be lured by his gifted oratory and empty promises and choose his type of populism over the boring, but moderate alternative.That would mean two parties that prefer culture wars and big-government easy buttons over abundance-oriented governance, with the nation swinging between its far-right and far-left flanks. Like Debs, I can see the dawn, but it's not leading to a better day for democracy.This column was first published in The Orange County Register.The post Mamdani's Win Offers Terrible Temptation for Democrats appeared first on Reason.com.",

        "description": "Why Musk won't ever realize the shareholder-approved Tesla payout Opinion At Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, more than 75 percent of voting shares backed a compensation deal for CEO Elon Musk that would make him history's first trillionaire....",
        "content": "Opinion At Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, more than 75 percent of voting shares backed a compensation deal for CEO Elon Musk that would make him history's first trillionaire. I've read that his record-shattering deal had the stockholders up on their feet dancing, chanting his name, and applauding. To make Musk a trillionaire, over the next decade he must: This deal comes after Musk has already been awarded the largest compensation package, $56 billion , in corporate history. Courts have challenged this award, but even if Tesla loses its appeal, Musk will still get tens of billions. Of course, this is all chump change if Musk succeeds in his new deal's goals. But can he do all this? Let's look at the tape. Tesla's financial performance over the last three years has shown slowing growth, with declining profits and only modest increases in revenue. From 2023 through 2025, the company has faced rising costs, margin pressure, and growing competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market. In the United States, Tesla sold approximately 578,644 vehicles in 2024. This helped Musk maintain Tesla's dominance, with nearly 50 percent of the US EV market. However, US sales overall are estimated to have fallen 11 percent year-over-year for 2025. Musk blames, with reason, President Donald Trump for ending EV tax credits and imposing tariffs.​ Looking ahead, Musk said in July: \"We probably could have a few rough quarters.\" The rest of the world is far less rosy for Tesla. In China, Tesla's sales fell 8.4 percent from 2023 to 2024. More recently, in October 2025, Tesla's sales in China dropped to 26,006 vehicles. That's the lowest monthly total in three years. Across the pond, Tesla has fallen like a brick. In Germany , for instance, sales have dropped by more than half year-over-year. In the EU and UK, European luxury cars, unbound by US tariffs, and Chinese EV manufacturers, such as BYD, which is blocked from the American market, are surpassing Tesla. BYD, in particular, with its cheaper prices, fast charging, and good range, has seen explosive growth. What this has meant for the bottom line is Tesla's revenue and income have been stagnant to declining. In 2024, the company's annual revenue increased to $97.69 billion, but that's less than 1 percent growth from 2023. Simultaneously, net income declined to $7.15 billion from $14.97 billion. 2025 looks far worse. Tesla saw its revenue for the trailing 12 months down about 1.5 percent year-over-year. Net profits continued to fall, with Q3 2025 reporting a 37 percent drop in profit compared to the previous year, namely $1.37 billion, down from $2.17 billion. You may have noticed I haven't said a thing about Musk's volatile online personality, his politics, or his constant bouncing from one project to another. That's because, love him or hate him, from a purely business perspective, Tesla is no longer the bright, shining star of electric cars. Under Musk's distracted leadership, Tesla has been in decline. The hope is that a trillion-dollar carrot will keep Musk's attention focused on Tesla rather than playing with politics or any of his many other companies such as SpaceX, X, or xAI. The only way Musk will get his trillion is if he achieves all his compensation plan's moonshot goals. It's not quite an all-or-nothing contract, but it's not too far from that either. The cold hard numbers, though, tell me he can't do it. I don't think anyone could. Tesla's stockholders are delusional. No one is worth a trillion dollars, certainly not someone whose corporate results in the last few years have been mediocre. AI, cryptocurrency, gold, and Tesla. Way too many of the one percent, and those who desperately want to be in the one percent, think that all they need is to plant some magic crypto beans or follow the right leader, and they'll become high-figure millionaires or billionaires. Some day soon, and it won't be long, the money merry-go-around will stop spinning and all those dreams will come crashing to a halt. ®",

        "content": "In today’s competitive market, companies of all sizes are looking for ways to cut unnecessary costs without affecting productivity. One of the most effective yet often overlooked ways to reduce monthly spending is by switching from personal mobile plans to dedicated business mobile phone contract . For many small and medium sized businesses, this change delivers immediate savings along with long term financial and operational benefits. Business mobile contracts are designed specifically for commercial use. They offer pricing structures, allowances and management features that consumer plans simply do not provide. As a result, businesses are finding they can lower communication costs while improving flexibility and control across their teams. Lower Monthly Costs with Business Pricing Business contracts often include bulk discounts, multi-SIM deals, and shared data options. These allow companies to consolidate their mobile expenses and pay significantly less per user compared with individual consumer plans. Many networks also provide tailored packages based on industry needs. For example, field teams may require more data, while office staff may only need basic calling and messaging. Business plans make it easy to match usage to each role, which avoids overspending on unnecessary allowances. But, the best is yet to come! VAT Reclaim and Tax Efficiency One of the biggest financial benefits of business mobile contracts is the ability to reclaim VAT. Companies registered for VAT can typically reclaim the VAT portion of their mobile bills, which reduces the effective cost of every plan. Personal mobile contracts do not offer this advantage, so businesses using employee personal phones miss out on a legitimate tax saving. For larger teams, the difference can be substantial over a full year. Better Control Over Usage and Spending Business mobile contracts include tools to track data, monitor usage and manage spending in real time. This helps companies avoid bill shock caused by unexpected charges or data overuse. Some providers even offer caps, alerts and spend controls that allow businesses to set clear limits. With this level of visibility and accountability, companies can keep their telecoms budgets predictable and cost effective. Flexible SIM-Only Deals That Cut Device Costs Many businesses are now choosing SIM-only business plans . These allow the company to keep its existing devices while benefiting from low-cost business tariffs. SIM-only contracts are typically cheaper and ideal for employers who refresh devices less frequently or prefer to buy handsets outright. This approach keeps costs down while maintaining reliable communication for the team. More Suitable for Remote and Hybrid Working Modern business mobile plans support remote work by offering strong UK coverage, robust data allowances and options for international calling or roaming. This avoids the need to reimburse employees for personal usage or deal with inconsistent costs. With predictable billing and work-ready connectivity, businesses save time and money while keeping their teams productive wherever they work. Additional Business Benefits Beyond cost savings, business mobile and SIM contracts often include extras designed specifically for commercial use, such as: Priority customer support Account managers for larger teams Fast replacements for lost or damaged SIMs Enhanced security features Integration with VoIP or unified communications systems These features improve reliability and reduce downtime, which can be just as valuable as the direct financial savings. Final Thoughts: The Smart Way to Reduce Mobile Costs Switching to business mobile and SIM contracts is one of the simplest ways for companies to reduce their communication costs. With lower pricing, VAT reclaim, better usage control and tailored options for modern working, business contracts consistently deliver higher value than consumer plans. For any organisation looking to cut costs while maintaining strong connectivity, reviewing and upgrading to business mobile plans is a smart and cost-effective step. read more from techbullion",

        "title": "\"The real money isn’t in the box\" - Analysts are torn on Steam Machine pricing, but I'm hopeful it won't be $1,000",
        "description": "Steam Machine price predictions are coming in fast, but as an editor who's covered major hardware launches for years, I'm not convinced it'll cost $1,000.",
        "content": "As you'd absolutely expect, Steam Machine price predications are making the rounds following Valve's announcement. As an editor who's been on the ground for many major hardware launches, I have my own theories on how much the storefront giant will want for its wee console rival. However, some experts are fearful that it could cost up to $1,000, largely thanks to the current economic climate.The $1,000 Steam Machine guesstimation comes from Michael Futter, founder of video game consultancy firm F-Squared (via Ars Technica). The analyst predicts that players should brace for a “hefty price tag” that will start at $799 for the base 512GB box and reach up to a grand for a model with 2TB storage. This theory is corroborated by David Cole, CEO of the research firm DFC Intelligence, who estimates the price range will be between $800-$1,000.I'm not convinced that's the price tag Valve will actually aim for, and Cole does say that the hardware maker will likely seek “very low margins.\" That's based on the assumption that the gaming PC titan isn't considering taking a loss on the system, though, something Superdata Research founder Joost Van Dreunen believes could help the box hit as low as $549.(Image credit: Valve)“Just like Sony and Microsoft, the real money isn’t in the box, it’s in the ecosystem you enter once you buy it,” says Van Dreunen. This is a reference to the fact that consoles like PS5 and Xbox Series X are initially sold at a loss to encourage players to their respective platforms.The expert caveats this by saying, “To me, the question isn’t whether Valve can afford to eat margin. It’s whether they want the SteamOS footprint to grow fast enough to justify it. ... Strategically, this is about expanding the platform, not squeezing the hardware.\"The idea of taking the hit to get the Steam Machine off the ground is backed up by Pitchbook's Eric Bellomo, who believes Valve “could use this hardware as a loss leader to expand the Steam ecosystem.” The senior analyst does admit that “Sony’s adoption of premium pricing underscores the need to maintaining profit margins and manage supply chain inflation, though Valve has breathing room as a private company.”Bellomo's take on Steam Machine pricing actually aligns with my own, as Valve's choice of specs feels like it'll slot nicely between the Xbox Series X and PS5 Pro. That would suggest the mini gaming PC will start at $549, matching the Steam Deck OLED and potentially using the same scaling range with a 1TB version at $649 and 2TB model maintaining the trend at $749.The ultimate issue here is that tech prices are increasing sporadically, thanks to fresh US tariffs impacting end costs and increasing demand for components like RAM and storage. I suspect those two factors are the reason we didn't get an official MSRP as part of the initial unveiling, as just like with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch earlier this year, Valve will want to dial in pricing just right before locking in.There are a few things that could ensure Valve succeeds in picking an approachable Steam Machine price point. The first is the specs themselves, as the company has opted for an older AMD chipset that's comparable to the Radeon RX 7600 in terms of graphical performance. The \"semi-custom\" part of the architecture used will likely lend itself to AI core features that will allow for a 4K 60fps experience closer to the PS5 Pro, all while avoiding costs of going for a more expensive off-the-shelf newcomer.(Image credit: Valve)This may sound silly, but Valve has likely developed a manufacturing strategy as a result of creating its best gaming handheld contender. Both devices are completely different beasts, but not having to include a screen or even integrate controls with the new box leaves wiggle room for higher cost components within the Steam Machine compared to the Steam Deck.I also fully believe that the newly released ROG Xbox Ally X is something of a cautionary tale for the upcoming Steam Machine. The new handheld perfectly demonstrates a situation where the hardware is great, but the pricing is incompatible with console player budgets. Valve has an opportunity to pitch its new hardware family (including the new Frame VR headset and Steam Deck), as the affordable option on the market amid price increases on rivals like the Series X and the Meta Quest 3.Of course, the question circles back to whether Valve can absorb the costs. I'm inclined to believe it absolutely can, given that the private company doesn't have to appease shareholders and is already in a strong position, and the fact that SteamOS is starting to make its way to other devices suggests that the longstanding PC corporation is really going to expand its platform into the console market.And hey, if things are looking a little shaky, it could always announce Half-Life 3 as an exclusive.More mini gaming PCs at AmazonSteam Deck alternatives at AmazonAlready got Valve's portable PC?

        "content": "Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and other economists have sounded the alarm about the U.S. national debt, stating that it poses a significant threat to the country’s security and global standing. Top Economists Weigh In On Mounting Debt Haass highlighted the potential dangers posed by the $38 trillion national debt. In an exclusive interview with Fortune, he warned that this could lead to a “national security crisis,” with the debt already impacting the country’s ability to allocate resources effectively. Haass outlined two potential scenarios: the first one, a dramatic “cliff” scenario triggered by a failed Treasury auction or geopolitical coercion, and a quieter but still dangerous second scenario where the debt continues to rise, squeezing defense budgets and weakening U.S. leverage abroad. On the other hand, top economist and Berkeley professor, Barry Eichengreen has a different take on the American debt crisis. According to him, America's $38 trillion debt stems less from economics and more from extreme political polarization. In a Fortune interview, he argued that “Neither party is serious” about trimming the budget deficit and that both parties have abandoned fiscal discipline, offering rhetoric instead of real action. See Also: Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin Finally Gets A Big Win With New Glenn — And SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Couldn’t Help But Applaud Musk Touts Tech Growth, Trump Plans Tariff-Funded Debt Fix The U.S. national debt has been a cause for concern for some time. In September, billionaire investor Ray Dalio predicted a “debt-induced economic heart-attack” within three years, likening the U.S. deficit to a lifetime of overeating fatty foods and smoking. By October, the U.S. national debt had surpassed $38 trillion, raising concerns about the nation’s financial stability. This was the fastest trillion-dollar increase in debt outside of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the national debt continues to rise, experts are increasingly warning of the potential consequences for the U.S. economy and global standing. Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk have endorsed a technology-fueled growth led by AI and robotics as the “only way” forward to manage the mounting debt. At the same time, President Donald Trump has stated that he wishes to use the tariff revenue and trade investment money to address the fiscal issues.

Relations between the two countries have been rocky since 2023, when then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused India of killing a Sikh separatist leader outside a temple in Surrey, British Columbia. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government denied involvement and blamed Canada for harboring Sikh separatist groups, resulting in a in trade talks. However, US President Donald Trump’s trade policies have pushed the nations to revisit their positions as countries across the globe scramble to diversify supply chains and find new markets to shield their economies from Washington’s tariff onslaught. He has singled out India for purchasing Russian oil and imposed a crushing tariff of 50% that hit more than half of Indian exports to the US. The US has all trade talks with Canada in late October over a Canadian advertisement against Trump’s tariff policy. After Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister, the two countries have taken a series of steps in repairing ties, including their envoys and seeking to a information-sharing framework to curb cross-border crime.

        "content": "[Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:21:13 +0300] Beijing – Saba: China's factory output and retail sales grew at their slowest pace in over a year in October, adding to the pressure on policymakers to revive the $19 trillion, export-driven economy. The mounting supply and demand pressures threaten to further reduce growth. For decades, officials tasked with maintaining the world's second-largest economy have faced a choice: to stimulate massive industrial production to boost exports if domestic consumer spending weakens, or to tap into the public treasury to finance GDP-boosting infrastructure projects. But the US tariff war is making it clear that China's reliance on the world's largest consumer market alone cannot generate substantial growth simply by expanding industrial parks, power plants, and dams. Friday's figures offered little hope for a swift turnaround, and the worse the data becomes month after month, the more urgent the need for reform grows. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that industrial output grew 4.9% year-on-year in October, the weakest annual pace since August 2024, compared to a 6.5% increase in September. Retail sales, a measure of consumption, expanded by 2.9% last month. This was also its weakest pace since August 2024, down from a 3% increase in September, compared to expectations of a 2.8% rise. \"The Chinese economy is under pressure from all sides,\" said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. Policymakers acknowledge the need for change to address unprecedented imbalances between supply and demand, boost household consumption, and tackle high levels of local government debt. However, they also recognize that structural reform will be painful and politically risky at a time when Trump's trade war has further strained the economy. Separate data released last week showed that China's exports unexpectedly plummeted in October, as producers struggled to make a profit in other markets after months of pre-loading goods to avoid the threat of US tariffs.",

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had extended this timeframe for exporters to 15 months during 2020 during the COVID-19 period. Earlier in the week, the government approved two schemes with a combined outlay of over Rs 45,000 crore for exporters, which are expected to help boost the country's outbound shipments and enhance the competitiveness of domestic goods in the global markets. The government on Wednesday approved the Export Promotion Mission (Rs 25,060 crore) and the Credit Guarantee Scheme (Rs 20,000 crore).Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Export Promotion Mission (EPM) will improve export competitiveness, help MSMEs, first-time exporters and sectors that are labour-intensive.",

        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover has reported a heavy loss for the three months to the end of September, a period during which it was badly affected by the impact of a serious cyber-attack. The carmaker posted a £485m loss – before tax and exceptional items - compared with a profit of £398m for the same period a year ago. The cyber-attack, which took place at the end of August, forced JLR to shut down its computer networks, leaving it unable to operate its highly-automated production lines throughout September and into early October. Car sales to consumers were also affected initially, although JLR was later able to develop workarounds, and parts supply to service outlets was badly disrupted. The company says production has now returned to normal levels. JLR also reported additional \"cyber related costs\" of £196m, on top of the headline loss. These are understood to include the costs of bringing in outside consultants and other support in response to the hacking attack. According to the carmaker, its revenues for the quarter fell 24%, from £6.5bn last year to £4.5bn. This was heavily affected by the production stoppage. However, the effects of US tariffs on exports from both the UK and Slovakia also had an impact, as did the phasing out of a number of Jaguar models ahead of the brands planned re-launch as an all-electric marque. The crisis at JLR helped drive UK car production in September to its lowest level for the month since 1952, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Its impact was also felt well beyond JLR itself. According to the Office for National Statistics, the drop in production of some 27,000 vehicles knocked 0.17% off economic output in September. The company sits at the top of a large and complex supply chain involving thousands of businesses worldwide, including hundreds in the UK, many of whom are heavily reliant on orders from the carmaker. The stoppage meant a large number of them, including small and medium sized businesses, were also forced to shut some or all of their operations – prompting warnings of potential bankruptcies. The government agreed to provide guarantees for JLR to obtain loans worth up to £1.5bn in order to help its supply chain. Separately, the carmaker itself set up a financing scheme, allowing suppliers to obtain early payment for new orders, in order to ease their cashflow.",

        "content": "In January, U.S. tariffs as high as 107% on Italian pasta makers could see your favorite pasta brands — like Barilla, Garofalo, and Rummo — get a lot more expensive, or disappear off store shelves entirely. A ruling by the U.S. Commerce Department hit 13 Italian pasta makers with a 92% tariff rate. That's on top of the existing 15% tariff on all exports from the E.U.While there are some U.S.-based pasta makers, the tariffs could make all pasta a lot more expensive overall. Fortunately, pasta is really easy to make — all you need is flour, eggs, water, and salt. I've been doing making pasta since I was a child, and still have some of the tools that my grandparents used. But, if you're getting into pasta making for the first time, here are five machines that make it a breeze. It's a lot of fun, too!If you have a KitchenAid Stand Mixer, this 3-piece attachment is probably all you'll ever need to make pasta. It includes a roller with adjustable thickness settings (so you can make flat sheets), as well as a spaghetti and a Fettuccine cutter. View DealIf you want to do things the old-fashioned way, a hand-cranked pasta maker is the way to go. This kit comes with a roller, tagliolini, and fettuccine cutter, but the company sells a number of other attachments to make spaghetti, vermicelli, pappardelle, and more.View DealIf you don't want to make dough by hand, then a pasta machine like this will be up your alley. Just dump in the ingredients, and in a few minutes, it will extrude spaghetti, penne, or fettuccine. View DealIf you want to go beyond spaghetti to tube-shaped pasta — penne, bucatini, rigatoni, fusilli, or macaroni — then this KitchenAid attachment is the one to get. It extrudes pasta like your kid's Play-Doh machine, so it's great to get them in on the action, too.View DealWhat if you want to make stuffed pasta? That's where you need something like this ravioli press, which makes short work of the process. Just lay out a sheet of pasta, fill the divots, place another sheet on top, and then roll it out. Best of all, this thing costs less than $20.View Deal",

        "description": "Growing Republican defiance and newly released Epstein emails leave Trump increasingly exposed as a House vote on unsealing the files edges closer",
        "content": "As pressure intensifies for Congress to hold a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, Donald Trump appears increasingly politically vulnerable, with efforts to halt the growing clamour — including appeals to Republican holdouts — failing to gain traction. Trump is now facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the Epstein files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed. The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him. Boebert reportedly stood firm on supporting the petition after being invited by Trump to the White House in an attempt to persuade her to withdraw her signature, according to the New York Times . The outlet reported that the meeting happened hours after Democrats on the House of Representatives’ oversight committee released a trove of emails from the files that suggested that Trump may have known more about Epstein’s underage sex-trafficking activities than he previously acknowledged. The disgraced late financier – who committed suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial – wrote in one email that Trump, his former close friend, “knew about the girls.” The New York Times reported that the White House sought to persuade Boebert to change her mind – enlisting Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and the FBI director, Kash Patel – before issuing “vague threats” when the tactic did not work. The paper, citing people “familiar with her thinking,” reported that the hardline approach had the counterproductive effect of persuading Boebert that there may be a conspiracy to conceal the contents of the files and caused her to dig in. Trump was reported to have unsuccessfully tried to contact Mace, who is running for governor of South Carolina, by phone. She subsequently wrote him a letter explaining her history of sexual abuse and rape, and explaining that she could not change her mind on the petition. She later wrote in a social media post that “the Epstein petition is deeply personal.” Two other Republican representatives, the formerly fiercely reliable Trump loyalist and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, have signed the petition. The necessary 218 votes to pass it and allow a House of Representatives vote was achieved this week with the swearing-in of the Democratic member, Adelita Grijalva, more than two months after she won a special election in Arizona following the death of her father, who had been the sitting representative. Democrats have accused Mike Johnson, the House speaker, of deliberately delaying Grijalva’s oath-taking in an attempt to deny the petition enough votes to pass and stall the possibility of a vote. Trump has lobbied behind the scenes to stop a vote reaching the floor of the House. Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California, forecast that between 40 and 50 Republicans could vote to release the files in a final vote, allying themselves with Democrats who will vote in favour. The legislation would still have to go to the Senate, where it is unlikely to pass. Trump, who was equivocal on whether he would release the files on the campaign trail last year, could veto a final bill even if it passed both houses. However, the very prospect of a vote in favor by the Republican-controlled House could spell serious political trouble for Trump, as it could fuel the clamor among his political base for the files to be unsealed and undermine their support for him. Politico quoted a Trump ally as saying that the latest email releases had taken “things that are already complicated for the president and [brought] them to the surface.” “It’s like adding salt to a dish – the flavours are already there, it just accentuates all of them,” the unnamed ally said. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, labelled the email releases as “a distraction campaign by the Democrats and the liberal media.” “It’s why I’m being asked questions about Epstein instead of the government reopening because of Republicans and President Trump,” she said. The renewed speculation over Epstein coincided with Trump signing into law a congressionally approved spending package that officially ended a federal government shutdown, which, lasting 43 days, was the longest in US history. It also comes after the supreme court signaled that it may strike down his signature tariffs policy. With inputs from agencies",

        "description": "[The Conversation Africa] Gold mining operations recently restarted at the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in western Mali after being shut down for several months.

        "content": "Gold mining operations recently restarted at the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in western Mali after being shut down for several months. In January, the Malian government started blocking exports from the mine owned by Canada-based Barrick Mining (formerly called Barrick Gold). The government blocked exports and took control of three tonnes of bullion following a dispute with Barrick Mining over alleged unpaid taxes. This particular case is too complex to be discussed here. But disputes over revenue distribution raise important questions about how mineral-rich countries can benefit from their natural resources. According to the International Monetary Fund, tax avoidance by multinational mining companies costs African countries between US$470 million and US$730 million per year in tax income . Keep up with the latest headlines on WhatsApp | LinkedIn Generating government revenue through natural resource taxation is critically important for sub-Saharan African countries seeking to improve infrastructure, health services and meet social development goals . A variety of reasons explain why mineral-rich countries in sub-Saharan Africa are not profiting appropriately from their mineral wealth. Power imbalances, unfavourable revenues The Intergovernmental Forum on Mining and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have identified different obstacles to mining revenue collection including faulty legislation, abusive transfer pricing and other artificial profit-shifting. In addition, fiscal incentives commonly provided to attract mining investment, such as significantly lowering tax and royalty rates, rarely prove to be worth the loss in government revenue. These excessive concessions to foreign mining companies have led to widespread discontent, poverty and underdevelopment in Africa, despite abundant mineral wealth. This situation has been condemned by leaders across the continent . In response, the African Union's African Mining Vision and the policies it has inspired, notably the reform of mining codes, are attempts to ensure a more lasting contribution of the continent's mineral resources. Yet the power imbalances between foreign companies and African governments remain very much in place and shape negotiations around mining codes, contracts and practices. While situations vary from country to country, sector to sector and site to site, research has sought to identify key obstacles to increased State mining revenue. The unequal influence in negotiations that favours mining companies leads to numerous irregularities. Examples include prolonging stability clauses despite regulatory reforms and prioritizing mining contracts over broader national regulatory frameworks. At the international level, African states are hindered from implementing policies that benefit local communities due to international trade regime practices, tariff import privileges and bilateral conventions that act as powerful deterrents. Mali's mining code In Mali, the mining sector is a key part of the economy . In 2022, the sector contributed 9.2 per cent of GDP, 76.5 per cent of export revenue and 34.8 per cent of state revenue. As is the case elsewhere on the continent, new Malian mining legislation aims to help rectify the legacy of environmental damage and disappointing mining revenue. Mali's 2023 mining code reflects reforms to improve national benefits from the sector similar to measures in Tanzania, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Such reforms included increased state ownership requirements (typically 10-30 per cent), higher royalty and tax rates, local content and employment requirements, greater environmental and social responsibility provisions and enhanced community development obligations. The 2023 code aims to strengthen Mali's sovereignty over its resources and bring about a more equitable distribution of the benefits. The fiscal regime has been reformed so that, among other measures, certain tax exemptions that mining companies received were abolished. Similarly, the new code puts an end to the fiscal concession of 25 per cent for a period of 15 years permitted by former codes. The new code introduces a royalty on production of 10 per cent for that exceeding the quantity projected. In addition, several funds were created to respond to the needs of the sector and favour social inclusion. Another important innovation is the law concerning local content in the mining sector . This law aims to encourage the participation of national enterprises and workers in the mining sector. As occurs in other mineral-rich countries, Mali has faced strong pushback, particularly from the largest and most powerful companies. This has led to an escalation of conflict rather than negotiated solutions. Significantly, several companies have reached agreements with the Malian government, such as Robex Resources . The U.K.-based Endeavour Mining has negotiated terms with the government to operate under the new mining code. Two additional gold producers have also signed agreements to operate under the new mining code: Faboula Gold and Bagama Mining . These projects, while less capital-intensive than others, illustrate the possibility of successful initiatives under the new code. They also provide important employment opportunities in rural areas.

Greater resource sovereignty Some industry analysts have criticized mineral-rich countries for adopting a \" resource nationalism \" approach. However, research shows that well-managed, transparent and stable mining revenue in Mali and Senegal could help improve access to health care and social services. Exercising greater sovereignty over natural resources to ensure the well-being of a country's population might better be commended as responsible resource nationalism. There are serious military and security threats facing Mali and its neighbours. By providing revenue and employment, the mining industry can play a key role in addressing these insecurities. This role involves respecting national regulations and paying a fair share of tax revenue. Ultimately, the industry's profitability is very much tied to the social stability of the country and the health, social and economic welfare of its people.

        "content": "Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend - Market Overview & Business Insights 11-14-2025 01:11 PM CET | Industry, Real Estate & Construction Press release from: Procurement Resource The Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend has emerged as a critical metric for manufacturers, construction firms, engineering contractors, fabrication units, and procurement managers across the globe. As stainless steel remains a core material for infrastructure, energy, petrochemicals, machinery, and consumer goods, understanding its price movement is essential for cost planning, project forecasting, and strategic sourcing. Request for Real-Time Prices:- In 2025, the market for stainless steel plates continues to evolve rapidly due to shifting global demand, raw material volatility, technological advancements in steel production, and momentum toward sustainable manufacturing. Businesses that track these price trends closely gain a competitive advantage by optimizing procurement cycles, reducing risks, and securing the best value from suppliers. Market Overview Stainless steel plates are produced in various grades-such as 304, 316, 310, and 321-each catering to different industrial requirements. Their pricing is directly linked to: Raw material costs, particularly nickel, chromium, iron ore, and molybdenum Regional supply-demand dynamics Energy prices and production costs Import-export policies and tariffs Global macroeconomic trends Over the past few quarters, stainless steel plate prices have shown mixed movement. While some regions experienced upward pressure due to energy costs and raw material constraints, others saw stabilization driven by improved supply chains and enhanced production capacities. Key Factors Influencing Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend 1. Nickel and Chromium Prices Nickel is the most influential raw material in stainless steel production, especially for austenitic grades like 304 and 316. When nickel prices fluctuate-even by small margins-the impact on stainless steel plate pricing is immediate. Similarly, chromium contributes significantly to corrosion resistance. Any shortage or policy-driven price surge results in upward pressure on stainless steel plate costs. 2. Energy and Production Costs Stainless steel manufacturing is energy-intensive. Rising electricity, natural gas, and coal prices increase mill-level production expenditures. Some countries have introduced carbon taxes and environmental compliance requirements, further pushing costs upward. Regions with stable energy prices or renewable energy integration often benefit from more consistent stainless steel pricing. 3. Demand from Construction and Infrastructure Construction and infrastructure development remain the backbone of stainless steel consumption. Large-scale metro projects, bridges, smart city initiatives, and public infrastructure directly impact stainless steel plate demand. With global infrastructure spending projected to rise in 2025, many regions expect moderate to strong demand, contributing to firm pricing. 4. Import-Export Regulations and Anti-Dumping Duties Price trends are heavily influenced by government policies. Several major economies impose anti-dumping duties on imported stainless steel to protect domestic industries. These policies alter supply dynamics, sometimes limiting availability or causing temporary price hikes. 5. Manufacturing Capacity and Supply Chain Stability Supply disruptions-such as logistics shortages, port congestion, or geopolitical restrictions-quickly affect stainless steel plate prices. Many countries have expanded production to address supply gaps, resulting in some price normalization. Regional Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend Analysis Asia-Pacific (APAC) The APAC region dominates stainless steel plate production, with China and India at the forefront. Increased manufacturing capacity and raw material accessibility offer competitive pricing. However, fluctuating nickel prices continue to influence short-term volatility. India's stainless steel industry particularly benefits from government initiatives encouraging domestic manufacturing. Europe European prices are comparatively higher due to strict environmental regulations, high energy costs, and premium quality standards. The region sees steady demand from the automotive, machinery, and chemical industries. North America The U.S. stainless steel plate market is shaped by infrastructure investments and anti-dumping duties that protect domestic mills. Prices generally remain stable but higher than Asian markets due to labor and production costs. Middle East & Africa Gradual industrial growth and large-scale energy projects influence demand. Pricing varies depending on imports, as local production is still developing. Industry Applications Driving Demand 1. Construction & Infrastructure Stainless steel plates are widely used in structural components, bridges, industrial buildings, and architectural projects due to their durability and corrosion resistance. 2. Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals High-grade stainless steel plates are essential for pipelines, reactors, pressure vessels, and offshore equipment. 3. Food & Beverage Processing Hygiene standards require stainless steel plates in machinery, storage tanks, preparation surfaces, and food-grade containers. 4. Automotive & Railways The sector increasingly uses stainless steel for body parts, exhaust systems, cargo containers, and safety components. 5. Heavy Machinery & Industrial Equipment Fabrication units rely on stainless steel plates to build machine frames, heat exchangers, conveyors, and industrial storage units. Forecast for Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend (2025-2026) Analysts anticipate a moderately stable price outlook with short-term fluctuations due to nickel market volatility. Key forecasts include: Steady demand from construction, renewable energy, and petrochemical sectors Technological improvements in steel manufacturing reducing production costs Shift toward green steel influencing price structures Continued volatility in raw material markets due to geopolitical factors The overall expectation points toward controlled upward movement, especially for premium grades. Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend :- Procurement Insights for Businesses 1. Adopt Long-Term Contracts Locking in prices with reliable mills or distributors helps mitigate market volatility. 2. Monitor Raw Material Indexes Tracking LME nickel and chromium prices provides early indicators of movement. 3. Diversify Suppliers Having multiple regional suppliers ensures consistent availability and competitive pricing. 4. Evaluate Inventory Strategies Bulk purchasing during price dips helps reduce annual procurement expenditure. 5. Focus on Grade Optimization Choosing the right grade based on application prevents overspending. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What is driving the Stainless Steel Plate Price Trend in 2025? The trend is influenced by nickel and chromium prices, demand from construction and energy sectors, energy costs, and government import policies. 2. Which stainless steel grade is most affected by nickel prices? Austenitic grades such as 304 and 316 are highly dependent on nickel, making them more vulnerable to price swings. 3. Which region currently offers the most competitive stainless steel plate prices? Asia-Pacific, particularly China and India, generally provides the most competitive pricing due to large-scale production capacities. 4. Will stainless steel plate prices increase in the coming months? Moderate price increases are possible due to rising global infrastructure demand and raw material fluctuations. However, production expansions may help stabilize costs. 5. How can businesses reduce procurement costs? Long-term contracts, monitoring raw material indexes, supplier diversification, and bulk purchasing during price dips can significantly reduce costs. 6. Are environmental regulations impacting stainless steel pricing? Yes. Countries with strict emission norms have higher production costs, influencing plate prices. 7. What industries consume the most stainless steel plates? Major consumers include construction, petrochemicals, heavy machinery, automotive, and food processing industries.

        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover has plunged to a heavy loss after booking almost £200 million in costs linked to a major cyber attack which saw the firm shut its factories for more than a month. The UK’s largest car manufacturer said it has “made strong progress” in recovering its operations at pace since the attack. JLR stopped production across its UK factories for five weeks from September 1 after being targeted by hackers a day earlier. All of the group’s manufacturing sites – including factories in Solihull, West Midlands, and Halewood, Merseyside – restarted operations last month. However, it saw revenues plummet by more than £1 billion, around 24%, to £4.9 billion for the quarter to September. It also swung to an underlying loss of £485 million over the quarter, sliding from a profit before tax and exceptional items of nearly £400 million over the same period in 2024. In the update, it booked £196 million of extra costs linked to the cyber attack and £42 million related to voluntary redundancies. The company said its performance was also impacted by US tariffs and a planned wind down in the production of previous Jaguar models.",

        "content": "South Korea will “move forward” with the United States in building nuclear-powered submarines, President Lee Jae Myung said Friday, after a long-awaited security and trade agreement was finalised.Analysts say developing the atomic-powered vessels would mark a significant leap in Seoul’s naval and defence industrial base, allowing it to join a select group of countries with such vessels.“One of the greatest variables for our economy and security — the bilateral negotiations on trade, tariffs and security — has been finalised,” Lee told a news conference, adding the two countries had agreed to “move forward with building nuclear-powered submarines”.Seoul had secured “support for expanding our authority over uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing”, he said.A joint fact sheet outlining the deal said both sides would “collaborate further through a shipbuilding working group” to “increase the number of US commercial ships and combat-ready US military vessels”.Beijing, on Thursday, voiced caution over a Washington-Seoul deal on nuclear submarine technology.The partnership “goes beyond a purely commercial partnership, directly touching on the global non-proliferation regime and the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the wider region,” Dai Bing, China’s ambassador to Seoul told reporters.Details remain murky on where the nuclear submarines will be built.US President Donald Trump said on social media last month that “South Korea will be building its Nuclear Powered Submarine in the Philadelphia Shipyards, right here in the good ol’ U.S.A”.– Billions in investments –US nuclear technology is among its most sensitive and tightly guarded military secrets.However, Seoul’s national security advisor Wi Sung-lac said on Friday that “from start to finish, the leaders’ discussion proceeded on the premise that construction would take place in South Korea”.“So the question of where construction will take place can now be considered settled,” he added.As part of the deal, South Korea has pledged to buy $25 billion-worth of US military equipment and plans to “provide comprehensive support for US Forces Korea amounting to $33 billion”.Details of a tariffs agreement were also announced.Trump unexpectedly declared at last month’s APEC summit that the two sides had reached a deal on an investment package and auto tariffs, before clarifying it was “pretty much” finalised.Seoul later said the $350-billion agreement included $200 billion in cash investment and $150 billion in shipbuilding cooperation, adding that both sides agreed to keep reciprocal tariffs and lower auto tariffs at 15 percent.Semiconductor tariffs, however, were not included in the deal at the time.The fact sheet stated that South Korea’s semiconductor tariffs will be “no less favorable than terms that may be offered in a future agreement covering a volume of semiconductor trade at least as large as Korea’s”, but did not give further details.South Korea is home to Samsung Electronics and SK hynix and produces a significant chunk of high-end chips that have become the lifeblood of the global economy, powering everything from smartphones to missiles.The country’s semiconductor exports reached a record high of $142 billion in 2024, accounting for more than a fifth of the country’s total exports.hs/ep/dan/jmThe post South Korea says to ‘move forward’ on nuclear subs with US appeared first on Vanguard News.",

        "content": "New Delhi, Nov 14 (PTI) The Reserve Bank has permitted exporters to bring proceeds of their shipments in 15 months as against the prevailing timeframe of 9 months in view of stress being faced by them. Exporters are facing issues due to a steep tariff imposed by the US on Indian shipments since August. The US imposed a steep 50 per cent tariff on goods from India, which took effect on August 27. Currently, the value of goods or software exports made by exporters is required to be realised fully and repatriated to the country within a period of nine months from the date of export. The changes have been made following amendments to the Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods & Services) Regulations. These regulations may be called the Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods and Services) (Second Amendment) Regulations, 2025, a gazette notification dated November 13 by RBI regional director Rohit P Das said. \"They shall come into force from the date of their publication in the Official Gazette,\" it said. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had extended this timeframe for exporters to 15 months during 2020 during the COVID-19 period. Earlier in the week, the government approved two schemes with a combined outlay of over Rs 45,000 crore for exporters, which are expected to help boost the country's outbound shipments and enhance the competitiveness of domestic goods in the global markets. The government on Wednesday approved the Export Promotion Mission (Rs 25,060 crore) and the Credit Guarantee Scheme (Rs 20,000 crore). Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the Export Promotion Mission (EPM) will improve export competitiveness, help MSMEs, first-time exporters and sectors that are labour-intensive.

        "description": "The dimmer outlook for UOB comes after higher loan provisions dragged down its earnings for the quarter.",
        "content": "SINGAPORE - Analysts are positive on DBS and OCBC after the two banks posted strong third-quarter results, but more wary of UOB, whose earnings for the period were hit by higher loan provisions. They also cautioned that all three banks could face more pressure on lending margins as interest rates fall and earlier hedges expire, even though DBS’s hedging strategy has helped cushion the impact of lower Singapore and Hong Kong benchmark rates so far. Interest rate hedges are financial contracts that help banks keep earning a steady interest income even when market rates fall. The analysts added that an earnings rebound at UOB could be on the cards with its provision buffers now built up and credit costs expected to return to normal. Singapore’s three largest banks posted mixed third-quarter results last week, with DBS and OCBC beating forecasts, and UOB falling short of expectations on the back of a $1 billion hike in credit provisions. DBS’s group net interest income (NII) for the quarter was mostly unchanged from a year ago at $3.58 billion, due to strong deposit growth and hedging strategies. This was despite net interest margins (NIM) falling to 1.96 per cent from 2.11 per cent a year earlier. NIMs are the difference between what a bank earns from loans and what it pays on deposits. DBS shares hit a high of $55.59 on Nov 7. The stock closed down 0.41 per cent at $53.99 on Nov 14. However, as its hedges roll off, or expire, and interest rates continue to decline, the bank’s NIM is expected to come under pressure going forward, said Morningstar’s director of Asia equity research Lorraine Tan. This is because banks often use hedges to lock in higher interest rates for a period. But once they expire, the bank is exposed to the current, lower-rate environment, which can squeeze NIMs. Macquarie Group’s head of Asean equity research Jayden Vantarakis said DBS has a total of $200 billion in fixed rate assets and hedges, with $78 billion rolling off in 2026. “The rates outlook presents a headwind, especially as the hedge book unwinds,” said Mr Vantarakis. In 2026, DBS expects total income to be around 2025 levels despite the lower interest rates, while net profit is expected to be slightly below 2025 levels. This is due to group NII forecast to come in slightly below 2025 levels. Still, Ms Tan of Morningstar said that DBS’s strong wealth franchise could cushion it from interest rate headwinds, while OCBC Investment Research and RHB said that the impact of lower rates and the lower NII projection are expected to be mitigated by deposit growth Analysts, however, are mixed on how much further DBS’s share rally can run. Ms Tan said that DBS shares are “not cheap” and appear “overvalued”. “We believe DBS’ strength against peers has already been priced in, and shares are now overvalued trading at a 15 per cent premium to our valuation,” she said, citing a fair value estimate of $48. Raising its fair value estimate for DBS shares from $54 to $55, head of OCBC Investment Research Carmen Lee said that DBS’s capital return strategy should provide strong share price support. In 2026, DBS plans to increase its quarterly dividend payout to 81 cents per share, which includes a 6-cent increase in the ordinary dividend to 66 cents and a 15-cent capital return dividend. RHB kept its “buy” call on DBS with a target price of $59, saying the bank’s dividend and capital return thesis remains intact. Mr Vantarakis of Macquarie however, reckons DBS will underperform, and expects its shares to be worth $46 in 12 months. At UOB, credit provisions jumped more than fourfold to $1.36 billion from $304 million a year earlier, as the bank bolstered coverage amid ongoing macro and sector-specific headwinds. That lifted its general allowance coverage to 1 per cent of performing loans. UOB said that its dividend payment would not be affected by the pre-emptive general allowance. Credit costs, which surged to 134 basis points in the third quarter from 36 basis points a year earlier, are expected to fall back to 25 to 30 basis points in the fourth quarter and into 2026. RHB noted that while the hike in provisions has made a dent in UOB’s profits, 2026 earnings should see a rebound given that the provision buffers are built up and credit costs are expected to return to normal levels. The bank kept its “neutral rating” on the stock at a target price of $36.10. Mr Vantarakis of Macquarie said the firm believes provisions are now adequate, but added that investors will look out for normalisation. “It’s clear that a lot of scepticism remains, which means that a couple of quarters of normal provisions will be required for stock outperformance,” he said. “We upgrade from underperform to neutral as the large provision charge in third quarter 2025 clears the decks for better sequential performance,” he added. CreditSights senior analyst Karen Wu noted that UOB’s pre-tax profits in the first nine months of 2025 would still fall 16 per cent year on year, even after stripping out the impact of the extra general provisions. UOB’s conservative credit cost guidance of 25-30 basis points for fourth quarter and 2026 – higher than its peers – indicates limited room for general provision write-backs, she added. Ms Lee from OCBC Investment Research added that UOB’s recent share price drop offers an opportunity to accumulate the stock, which she estimates has a fair value of $38.20. The stock fell 0.29 per cent to close at $34 on Nov 14. Meanwhile, OCBC emerged as a standout among the three banks, with analysts citing robust NII and solid wealth momentum that stood out among its peers. Ms Wu of CreditSights said the bank’s strong non-interest income growth amid exceptionally high net new money inflows, which boosted wealth management fees, more than offset weaker NII and higher provisions at OCBC. The bank’s third quarter non-interest income rose 15 per cent year on year to $1.57 billion from fee, trading and insurance income growth. This helped keep net profit steady at $1.98 billion, largely unchanged from $1.97 billion a year earlier, and which beat a $1.79 billion forecast in a Bloomberg poll. Mr Vantakaris said that OCBC’s wealth momentum, measured by fee growth and assets under management increase, was the highest amongst peers, setting a strong base for 2026. “OCBC is our preference amongst the Singapore banks, over DBS and UOB. The balance sheet is most defensively positioned in terms of exposure to trade and general allowances.” “Guidance has also been conservative, presenting less risk to the outlook relative to peers,” he said. The analyst is upgrading OCBC to “outperform” with a 12-month target price of $19.90. Ms Tan of Morningstar said that OCBC’s third-quarter annualised credit cost remains low at 16 basis points, mostly consisting of special provisions, as the bank had already provided for macroeconomic risks related to tariffs earlier this year. “With general allowance coverage of 0.9 per cent, we don’t expect sizable provisions going forward,” she said. OCBC shares closed down 0.75 per cent to $18.52 on Nov 14.",

Citing a source in the Korean auto industry, the EToday news website reported that it will take at least one to two months for the effects of the tariff reduction to be felt, meaning that companies will continue to face significant short-term liquidity pressure.Yonhap’s analysis pointed out that Korean automobile exports to the United States had previously enjoyed zero tariffs, and determining how to cope with the impact of U.S. tariffs on South Korea’s automotive industry will be a new challenge. Kim Pill-soo, a professor at Daelim University College, stressed that fundamentally, the U.S. tariff issue has not disappeared.Regarding the so-called modernized alliance, the U.S. reaffirmed its pledge to provide extended deterrence, while South Korea shared its plan to increase its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product as soon as possible.South Korea also shared its plan to provide comprehensive support for the U.S. Forces Korea amounting to 33 billion dollars in accordance with Seoul’s legal requirements while committing to spending 25 billion dollars on U.S. military equipment purchases by 2030.The United States gave approval for South Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines.",

        "title": "SBI backs another wave of bank mergers",
        "description": "SBI controls about one quarter of India’s ₹194 lakh crore loan market",
        "content": "State Bank of India (SBI) is supportive of another wave of mergers among state-backed lenders as policymakers explore ways to build scale and finance growth in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. “Some further rationalisation might make sense. There are still some smaller, sub-scale banks,” Challa Sreenivasulu Setty, chairman of the country’s biggest bank, said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Mumbai. “If another round happens, it may not be a bad idea,” he said. Mumbai-based SBI controls about one quarter of India’s ₹194 lakh crore ($2.18 trillion) loan market. A wave of local mergers over the past decade has left 12 state lenders competing with private and foreign players such as HDFC Bank Ltd and HSBC Holdings Plc. With a balance sheet of $787 billion, SBI dominates the industry, along with its more than 22,500 branches and over 500 million customers. India is discussing options to create large state lenders, which aligns with the government’s need to fund massive infrastructure and industrial projects in Asia’s third-largest economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to transform India into a developed economy by 2047. That vision requires bank financing to increase to about 130 per cent of gross domestic product from 56 per cent currently, supporting an expected ten-fold increase in GDP to roughly $30 trillion. Currently, only SBI and HDFC Bank rank in the top 100 global sector list by total assets. China and the US have rivals among the 10 biggest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While China and India have been saddled with some of the steepest US tariffs under President Donald Trump, New Delhi is undertaking reforms including tax cuts to lure foreign investments and take advantage of a rejig in global supply chains. Setty, who took the top job at the bank in late 2024, said that though exports had been impacted by additional US tariffs, SBI is yet to see major issues in any sector. “We are not pruning any exposure, we continue to support exporters. If any temporary adjustments or facility extensions are needed, we’re addressing those,” he said. SBI, which is 55 per cent-owned by the government, is seeing signs of an industry-wide revival of capital spending by corporates but pricing for loans is becoming tighter. “There are many banks looking to build corporate portfolios, but only a limited number of large corporates — so that segment will remain highly competitive,” said Setty. Last month, the lender raised its forecast for credit growth to 12 per cent to 14 per cent for its current year from a previous guidance of 11 per cent to 12 per cent. Setty, a SBI veteran of nearly 40 years, has had a humble start. From the age of 12, he spent his school vacations collecting debts for his father’s grocery store in the small south Indian village of Potlapadu. At the state-owned bank, one of Setty’s key tasks after the coronavirus lockdown was to head recovery of SBI’s nearly $20 billion bad-loan pile. According to Setty, SBI is keen to expand its market share further. “Even as a dominant player, our approach isn’t about defending market share but acquiring more,” he said, adding that he doesn’t see competition from foreign capital as a threat. The firm has total assets of nearly ₹69 lakh crore, with HDFC Bank taking the second spot at ₹40 lakh crore. A wave of billion-dollar deals in India’s banking sector has put the financial sector in the global spotlight as investors seek opportunities in the country. This builds on the momentum of foreign players investing in insurance and fintech firms. SBI’s shares have gained 19 per cent over the past one year versus a 16 per cent increase in the Nifty Bank index. At the same time, authorities have proposed a framework enabling lenders to directly fund corporate takeovers, a move expected to boost the country’s $40 billion-plus deals market. The draft guidelines ensure that no bank will have excessive exposure to M&A lending, according to Setty. “As for pricing, I expect some softening since more players, especially Indian lenders with access to lower-cost funds, will enter this space, he said. “However, M&A financing shouldn’t be treated like simple balance sheet funding. Each deal carries distinct risks, and pricing should reflect that, Setty said. As the country becomes a global hotspot for wealth management, banks are ramping up offerings and hiring aggressively to meet booming demand on the back of robust equity markets and real estate transactions. The firm hired 1,000 wealth relationship managers over the last 12 months, said Setty, adding that 2,000 roles were created internally to cater to its wealth customers. Setty said the financier has identified more than 110 micro-markets, mostly located in India’s metro and large urban centres, where it has opened so-called wealth hubs for clients. It plans to add another 50 to 100 hubs over the next two years. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com Published on November 14, 2025",

SBI, controlling about a quarter of India's ₹194 lakh crore loan market, sees potential benefits in further rationalization of smaller banks. The move aligns with India's goal to become a developed economy by 2047, requiring bank financing to increase significantly. SBI, with a $787 billion balance sheet, is a dominant player alongside HDFC Bank, both ranking in the top 100 global sector list by total assets.",

        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover has plunged to a heavy loss after booking almost £200 million in costs linked to a major cyber attack which saw the firm shut its factories for more than a month. The UK’s largest car manufacturer said it has “made strong progress” in recovering its operations at pace since the attack. JLR stopped production across its UK factories for five weeks from September 1 after being targeted by hackers a day earlier. All of the group’s manufacturing sites – including factories in Solihull, West Midlands, and Halewood, Merseyside – restarted operations last month. However, it saw revenues plummet by more than £1 billion, around 24%, to £4.9 billion for the quarter to September. It also swung to an underlying loss of £485 million over the quarter, sliding from a profit before tax and exceptional items of nearly £400 million over the same period in 2024. In the update, it booked £196 million of extra costs linked to the cyber attack and £42 million related to voluntary redundancies. The company said its performance was also impacted by US tariffs and a planned wind down in the production of previous Jaguar models.",
